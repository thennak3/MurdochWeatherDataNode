# MurdochWeatherDataNode
 Processor for Murdoch weather data created with node.js

This application was designed to display data from a variety of possible files and file types utilising a mixture of NodeJS, html, css and javascript technologies. The design was to provide a simple user interface for the client whereby 2 dates were selected, what information and how it was to be displayed. 

To display information three types of information required were identified. Two dates being a start and end, data selection with three choices, that being all, wind speed and solar radiation and finally a choice between chart and table. 
Output is to be calculated and either averaged or totalled for a month and output is limited to be within a one year period only. Chart output is presented in a line diagram format, this was best as itâ€™d present a smooth flow from one month to another and allow easier comparisons.

To avoid sending the user to separate pages a single page layout was chosen, this proved to be quicker for both presenting data as well as allowing the user to enter another search.
